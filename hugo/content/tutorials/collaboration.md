In [the Library tutorial](/tutorials/library/) we created a library of states that were interesting for various reasons and pushed them to the hub.

In this tutorial, we clone the (code, data) pair that exhibited one of the bugs in particular, and fix it!

{{% overview %}}
* [Dotmesh on Docker](/install-setup/docker/).
* Or try this example on our [hosted demo](/install-setup/katacoda/).

## Run through the library tutorial

If you haven't done the library tutorial yet, then do that first.
You need access to the state in your dothub account (either as an owner or a collaborator of a dot) before you can clone it.

## Use a fresh environment

If you've just finished the [the Library tutorial](/tutorials/library/), you'll still have the state locally.
Since the whole point of this tutorial is to demonstrate cloning that state to a different environment, you'll have more fun if you use the [katacoda](https://dotmesh.com/try-dotmesh/) environment to pretend that you didn't just create the state that's being cloned.
