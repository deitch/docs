And yet still further pondering—while I moved him now and then from between the whale and ship, which would threaten to jam him—still further pondering, I say, I saw that this situation of mine was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes; only, in most cases, he, one way or other, has this Siamese connexion with a plurality of other mortals. If your banker breaks, you snap; if your apothecary by mistake sends you poison in your pills, you die.</p>

But handle Queequeg's monkey-rope heedfully as I would, sometimes he moved it so, that I came very near sliding overboard. Nor could I possibly forget that, do what I would, I only had the management of one end of it.</p>
